                        For my Eagle Scout Project, I wanted to impact a community that was in need so I partnered up
                        with
                        Sustainable Roots, a non profit organization working from Cosanga, Ecuador to build a Gazebo
                        for the community through fundraising. The goal was that the Gazebo could increase tourism to
                        the area
                        and provide people with an area where they can meet and birdwatch despite the frequent rain in
                        the
                        area. I spent 8 days in Cosanga leading a team of 10 in the construction of the Gazebo. We were
                        fortunate enough to be able to borrow tools from Sustainable Roots and a few community members
                        were also happy to help. I achieved the Rank of Eagle Scout later on in that same year. Since
                        the construction of the Gazebo, the community has had various meetings there because of its
                        central location to the village. Through this experience, I gained crucial leadership skills
                        that I have used and polished ever since.

                        Near the end of my Junior year of High School I had gotten the idea to team up with my Robotics
                        team
                        (FRC) to do a service project in Ecuador that is centered around spreading ideas of STEM and
                        starting
                        various robotics teams in the area. The goal of spreading ideas of STEM is to inspire the
                        children of Ecuador to learn about technology and someday enter into the tech industry
                        themselves. I gathered a team of 10 from my Robotics team and we spent
                        the month of July in Ecuador doing this outreach. One of the more memorable outreach activities
                        that we
                        engaged in was the restoration of an orphanage in Quito where we rennovated the children's
                        broken down playground, painted the walls with fun designs, and re-stocked their supplies with
                        new blankets, toys, food, etc.
                        The outcome was starting 9 teams in 1 month,
                        coordinating 2,500 hours of service, communicating with 20 academic administrations, and
                        impacting a
                        total of 300 children.
